## Project Video

In [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18I8VEoBQkyH1W3WHzC57kMqZALh1zr4X/view?usp=sharing), I showcase my project called What to Wear, a weather application that suggests clothing based on temperature. Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit and add their own clothing items for personalized suggestions. I discuss some challenges I faced, like organizing error classes and setting up a virtual machine, and I share my plans for future improvements, such as enhancing responsiveness and adding features to declutter user submissions.
